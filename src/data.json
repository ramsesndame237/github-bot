{"citation":{"author":"Barbara Corcoran","quote":"My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There's no way I can control him. I wouldn't stay married to him if I felt I could. I can readily take my business personality into the home. But he forces me to be a partner rather than the boss.","category":"business"},"date":"2023-08-03"}
